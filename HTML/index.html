			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p>Hello world!</p> 
				
			<p>My name is Mohnish Pai, and I'm a <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/ce/index.html">computer engineering</a> student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I've written code in C++, HTML, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and Verilog, and I've done research in semiconductor electrochemistry, ASIC placement and routing. My research interests also involve circuit design and neural networks. I like playing and modifying video games, cooking, watching YouTube, rock climbing, and dabbling with machine learning projects in my spare time.</p>

			<p>My interest in computers began at an early age. When I was four years old, I lived with my grandparents in India and had access to a PC that ran Windows XP. My father left the computer there since he was working in the US at the time, allowing me to tinker with it. I recall spending hours on it playing 3D Space Cadet Pinball and watching Tom and Jerry cartoons, and that experience cemented my passion for and immersion in the world of computing.</p>

			<p>Moving on to high school, my love for games would drive me to study more about the hardware that powered them. I'd obsessively investigate cutting-edge CPUs and how companies could obtain incremental performance increases over time. Furthermore, cryptocurrency mining became profitable around the same time, reinforcing my desire to delve deeper into ASIC design.</p>

			<p>When I enrolled in the <a href="https://tams.unt.edu">Texas Academy of Math and Science</a> high school program, I was able to gain a more in-depth understanding of semiconductor production. I conducted undergraduate research on copper etching methods in order to develop a regeneration cupric chloride solution for recurrent usage in etching batches. My experience learning about the chip manufacturing process led me to study more about digital design, which is what I do now at Texas A&M. I have worked on projects using ML models in VLSI circuit design and neural network chip design with Dr. Jiang Hu.</p>

			<p class="left">An implementation of a deep neural network processor using Verilog, Pytorch, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and C++. Designed for a regularity-based flow to achieve the highest throughput and lowest power consumption.</p>
			<p class="right">A fork of the <a href="https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/">Freqtrade</a> cryptocurrency trading platform that adds a trading algorithm based on the Fourier transform. Takes real-time and historical data from the price history of a cryptocurrency, applies FFT to the signal, and trades at regular intervals using the sine wave of the largest magnitude.</p>

			<h1>Qualifications</h1>
			<a href="resume.pdf"><img src="images/resume.jpg" href="resume.pdf" alt="Resume" width="40%"></a>
			<p class="right">My strongest languages, in which I have four years of experience, are Verilog, C++, and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. I also have extensive experience trading stocks, working with algotrading programming languages and frameworks like <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/Introduction.html">Pine</a>, <a href="https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/">Freqtrade</a>, and <a href="https://www.mql5.com/">MQL5</a>. This experience led me to place third in the DECA International Stock Market Game competition. Additionally, I have some expertise building and refining machine learning models.</p>

			<img src="images/scope_research.jpg" alt="Scope Research" width = 45%>
			<p class="right">As Undergraduate Director of the research volunteering organization Scope Research, I lead undergraduate research students to guide high school students through the research process. Our team of 20+ undergraduate and graduate students throughout A&M volunteered as mentors to guide high school students in their pursuit of academic research.
			<p>I interviewed multiple candidates to make sure that they understood our process and were interested in contributing to our goal. By constructing a set of research guidelines, I provided the undergraduate mentors with a standardized format and an end goal for them to reach with their high school mentees. Our team collaborated with more than 30 A&M research organizations to introduce more students to the research and mentorship process.</p>
